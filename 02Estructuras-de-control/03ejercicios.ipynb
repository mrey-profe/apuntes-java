    "Create a program that prompts the user for a student's grades and calculates the average grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a program that asks for a number and calculates its factorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise 3 ([https://wirtzjava.blogspot.com/])\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to gather statistical data for a subject, so we need a program that sequentially inputs the students' grades and displays:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The percentage of students who have passed the subject.\n",
    "- The percentage of good and excellent grades in the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise 4 ([https://wirtzjava.blogspot.com/])\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to create a small program to input into the onboard computer of our car that informs us of the average fuel consumption every 100 km. Design a program that takes the mileage from the last refueling, the current mileage, the liters of gasoline it had at the end of the last refueling, and the current amount of gasoline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should display the average fuel consumption of the car every 100 km.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise 5 ([https://wirtzjava.blogspot.com/])\n",
    "\n",
    "Design a program that takes three integers from the console. If all are negative, display the product of the three. If any are negative, but not all, display the sum of the three. If all are positive, sum the first two and multiply that sum by the third. Is there any combination of the input values not covered by the algorithm? (Assume that zero is a positive number). Make the program as simple as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise 6 ([https://wirtzjava.blogspot.com/])\n",
    "\n",
    "Design an algorithm that takes the number of hours, minutes, and seconds shown on a digital clock, verifies that the values are correct, and calculates the total seconds elapsed since the beginning of the day. Do not use Java date classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise 7 ([https://wirtzjava.blogspot.com/])\n",
    "\n",
    "By entering two dates (day, month, year), create a program that tells us which of the two is greater. We assume that valid dates are entered and do not use Java date classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise 8\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that accepts a carnival character and displays a personalized message for that character. For example, if the user enters \"Pirate\", the program could print \"Arr, get ready to sail the seven seas!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise 9\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a program that takes a number and ensures it is positive, meaning if we enter a number less than or equal to zero, it will prompt us to re-enter it as many times as necessary until a positive number is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise 10 ([https://wirtzjava.blogspot.com/])\n",
    "\n",
    "Design an algorithm that identifies perfect numbers between 1 and 10,000. A perfect number is one that is equal to the sum of all its divisors less than itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise 11 ([https://wirtzjava.blogspot.com/])\n",
    "\n",
    "Program the following game: The computer generates a random number between 0 and 99 that must be guessed. The player will try to guess the number, and the program will respond whether the guess is higher, lower, or correct. There is a maximum of 5 attempts.\n"
